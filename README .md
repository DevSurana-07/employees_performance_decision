# Employee Performance Analysis  

## ðŸ“Œ Project Problem Statement  
You are provided with a dataset (`employee_performance.csv`) containing ~4000 records with the following fields:  

- **Employee_ID**  
- **Department**  
- **Age**  
- **Salary**  
- **Projects_Completed**  
- **Working_Hours**  
- **Performance_Score (0â€“100)**  
- **Promotion_Status (Yes/No)**  

**Goal:**  
To **write short theory explanations** and perform **Python-based analysis** to explore employeesâ€™ performance and probability of promotion.

## âœ¨ Exam Tasks  

### Part A â€“ Theory (Short Questions)  

1. **Define Mean, Median, Mode with an example in the context of employee salaries.**  
2. **Differentiate between Range and Variance** with examples.  
3. What is the difference between **Normal Distribution and Poisson Distribution**?  
4. Explain **Skewness** and give one workplace-related example.  
5. Define **Conditional Probability** and explain how it applies in promotions.  
6. Explain **Independent vs Mutually Exclusive Events** with examples.  
7. What does **Bayes Theorem** help us in real-world decision-making?  
8. Write a short note on **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)** in simple words.

### Part B â€“ Practical (Python Programming)  

#### Step 1: Central Tendency & Dispersion  
- Find **mean, median, and mode** of Salary.  
- Calculate **variance and standard deviation** of Projects_Completed.  

#### Step 2: Probability & Events  
- Find the **probability of employees getting promoted**.  
- Create a **contingency table** between Promotion_Status and Department.  
- Compute **conditional probability**: P(Promotion | Performance_Score > 80).  

#### Step 3: Distributions & Visualization  
- Plot a **Histogram of Performance_Score** with a Gaussian curve.  
- Check **Skewness and Kurtosis** for Salary.  
- Draw a **Q-Q Plot of Projects_Completed**.  

#### Step 4: Linear Algebra Application  
Take the first 5 employeesâ€™ `[Projects_Completed, Working_Hours]` as **vectors**.  

- Perform **dot product** between two employee vectors.  
- Find **Norm 1 & Norm 2** of an employeeâ€™s work vector.  
- Compute the **angle** between two employeesâ€™ work vectors.
